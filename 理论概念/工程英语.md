## **女娲补天**

女娲是中国古代神话中的女神。当时,有两个更强大的神，共工和祝融之间发生了争吵,他们决定用拳头解决。当水神共工看到自己要输了,他用头撞了不周山，一根支撑天空的柱子。柱子坍塌了，导致天向西北倾斜，地向东南倾斜。这造成了巨大的灾难，如熊熊大火，巨大的洪水，也并出现了凶猛的食人野兽。女娲砍下一只巨龟的腿，用它们代替倒下的柱子，缓解了局势，用七种不同颜色的石头封住了破碎的天空，但她无法完全纠正倾斜的天空。这就解释了日、月、星向西北移动,中国的河流向东南流入太平洋的现象。

**参考译文：**

Nu Wa was a goddess in ancient Chinese [mythology.At](http://mythology.At) that time, there was a quarrel bet ween two more powerful gods. Gong Gong and Zhu Rong and they decided to settle it with fists. When the water god, Gong Gong, saw that he was losing, he smashed his head against Mount Buzhou, a pillar holding up the sky. The pillar collapsed and caused the sky to tilt towards the nort hwest and the earth to shift to the southeast.This caused great calamities, such as raging fires, vast floods, and the appearance of fierce man-eating beasts. Nu wa cut off the legs of a giant tortoise and used them to I supplant the fallen pillar, alleviating the situation and sealing the broken sky using stones of seven different colors, but she was unable to fully correct the tilted sky.This explains the phenomenon that sun, moon, and stars move towards the northwest, and that rivers in China flow southeast into the Pacific Ocean.

## **刻舟求剑**

春秋战国时期，楚国有个人坐船渡江时，不小心把自己的一把宝剑掉落江中。他马上掏出一把小刀，在宝剑落水的船舷上刻上一个记号，希望能够帮助他找到宝剑。船靠岸后，那楚人立即从船上刻记号的地方跳下水去捞取掉落的宝剑。然而一番搜索过后，他什么也没发现。

他怎么找得到宝剑呢?船继续行驶，而宝剑却不会再移动。像他这样去找剑难道不愚蠢吗？

**参考译文：**

In the Spring and Autumn Period, a man from the state of Chu was taking a boat across a river when he dropped his sword into the water carelessly. Immediately he made a mark on the side of the boat where the sword dropped, hoping it can be of help to find the sword. After the ship was in port, he went into the water to search for his sword at the place where he had marked the boat. However, nothing was found after a search.

How could he find his sword? As we know, the boat had moved but the sword had not. Isn’t this a very foolish way to look for a sword?

## 后羿射日

传说中国古时候，人们曾认为天上有十个太阳，他们以十天为一周期，轮流当值，。每天，这十个太阳都跟随太阳之母——羲和女神周游到西方的曙之谷。在那里，羲和沐日于甘泉，将太阳置于扶桑巨树的枝杈中。只有一个太阳会离开这课树，升到天空中开始一天的征程，直到抵达那处于遥远西方的日元山。

长此以往，太阳们有些无聊，于是他们决定一起周游天空。十个太阳散发的高温让大地上生灵涂炭。为了结束这场灾难，尧君去请求太阳之父帝俊，请他劝说孩子们不要同时出现。

然而，太阳们并不听话，帝俊便让神箭手后羿背上神弓，带上十枝箭去恐吓这些叛逆的太阳。不料后羿却接连射下九个太阳，只留下一个太阳在空中，也就是我们今天看到的那个。看到九个儿子惨死，帝俊勃然大怒，便将后羿贬下凡间成为一介布衣。

这就是后羿射日的故事。尽管后羿因此受到惩罚，但后人永远感念他的恩德。

**参考译文：**

In ancient China, people believed that there were ten suns that appeared in turn in the sky during the Chinese ten-day week. Each day the ten suns would travel with their mother, the goddess Xi He, to the Valley of the Light in the East. There, Xi He would wash her children in the lake and put them in the branches of an enormous mulberry tree called fu-sang. From the tree, only one sun would move off into the sky for a journey of one day, to reach the mount Yen-Tzu in the Far West.

Tired of this routine, the ten suns decided to appear all together. The combined heat made the life on the Earth unbearable. To prevent the destruction of the Earth, the emperor Yao asked Di Jun, the father of the ten suns, to persuade his children to appear one at a time.

They would not listen to him, so Di Jun sent the archer, Yi, armed with a magic bow and ten arrows to frighten the disobedient suns. However, Yi shot nine suns, only the Sun that we see today remained in the sky. Di Jun was so angry for the death of nine of his children that he condemned Yi to live as an ordinary mortal in the earth.

That’s the legend of Yi Shot Down the Suns . Although Yi got punished because of his behavior, people will always be grateful of him.

## 夸父追日

很久很久以前，有个名叫夸父的巨人。

A very long time ago there was a giant named Kuafu.

他看见太阳每天从东方升起，在西方落下，

He saw every day the sun rise from the east and sink

in the west.

接着就是漫长的黑夜，直到第二天早晨太阳才又从东方升起。

Then it was a lingering dark night and it wasn’t

until early next morning that the sun rose from the east again.

夸父心想：“每天夜里，太阳躲到哪里去了呢？

Kuafu figured: “Where does the sun hide every

night?

我不喜欢黑暗，我喜欢光明！

I don’t like darkness but I like brightness.

我要去追赶太阳，把它抓住，

I want to chase the sun and catch it.

叫它固定在天上，让大地永远充满光明。”

Then I will affix it in the sky so that earth is

forever full of brightness.”

---

于是夸父拿着手杖，提起长腿，迈开大步，

Therefore Kuafu held a walking stick in his hand

and marched forward in big steps.

像风似的奔跑，向着西斜的太阳追去，

He ran fast like wind to chase towards the setting

sun in the west.

一眨眼就跑了两千里。他一直追到虞渊，也就是太阳落下去的地方。

In the blink of an eye he had run two thousand

miles and chased all the way to Yuyuan where the sun sank.

还没等太阳落下去，夸父就追到了。

Before the sun dropped out of sight, Kuafu was able

to catch up to the sun.

一团又红又亮的火球，照着他的全身，

It was a lump of red and bright fireball shining on

his entire body.

他无比欢喜地举起两条巨大的手臂，想把这团火球抓住。

He was ecstatic and lifted his two gigantic arms in

an attempt to grasp this fireball.

---

就在这时候，夸父的喉咙干得直冒烟。

At that time, Kuafu’s throat was so dry it was

practically smoking.

他实在是太渴、太累了。

He was actually too thirsty and tired.

夸父伏下身子，去喝黄河、渭河里的水。

So he bent down to drink water from Yellow River

and Weihe River.

咕嘟咕嘟，霎时间两条大河都给他喝干了，可是还没止住口渴。

With a bout of gurgling sounds he drank the two

rivers dry in a flash, but his thirst had not been quenched.

---

夸父又向北方跑去，想去喝大泽里的水。

Kuafu ran towards the north with the intention to

drink water from a big lake.

那大泽，又叫“瀚海”，有上千里宽。

The big lake was called Hanhai that was a thousand

miles in width.

他还没到大泽，就像一座大山颓然倒了下来，大地和山河都因为他的倒下而发出巨响。

But before he reached the big lake he collapsed

like a big mountain and made a big sound as he fell on the vast land, mountains

and rivers.

这时，太阳正在虞渊落下去，把最后几缕金色的光辉洒在夸父的脸上。

At this time, the sun sunk down at Yuyuan and

sprinkled the last few golden beams of light on Kuafu’s face.

夸父遗憾地看着西沉的太阳，长叹一声，便把手杖奋力向前一抛，闭上眼睛长眠了。

Kuafu regretfully watched the sinking sun in the

west, let out a long sigh, threw the walking stick forward with all great force,

and died with his eyes closed.

---

第二天早晨，当太阳从东方升起，金光普照大地的时候，昨天倒在原野的夸父，已经变成了一座大山。

The next morning when the sun rose from the east

and its golden beams were shining everywhere on the vast land, Kuafu who fell

on the open wilderness had changed into a big mountain.

山的南边，有一大片枝叶茂密、鲜果累累的桃林，

On the southern edge of the mountain there was a

big expanse of peach woods with clusters of fruits and dense leaves/branches.

那是夸父的手杖变成的。

Those were changed from Kuafu’s walking stick.

树上味道鲜美的桃子，给追寻光明的人解渴，

The peaches on the trees were good-tasting and

provided to quench the thirst of people seeking brightness.

使他们精神百倍，奋勇前行。

After being energized, they could continue to brave on.
